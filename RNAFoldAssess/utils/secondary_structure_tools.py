        Returns true if the given RNA chain is symmeteric. This
        is useful because most prediction models assume an input
        sequence is a whole molecule and thus will only predict
        base-pairs among the given sequence. For example, a
        molecule may be of two chains with the following secondary
        structure:

        ...(((..&..)))...

        The output of x3dna and the `parse_structure_file` method
        above will return two chains from this secondary structure,
        neither of which will be symmetric:

        Chain 1 secondary structure:
        ...(((..
        Chain 2 secondary structure:
        ..)))...

        most (perhaps all) prediction algorithms cannot predict
        such a structure. If given the sequence to chain 1, a
        predictor will generate secondary structure predictions
        such as:

        ........
        ..(.)...
        (((..)))

        and so on. This method returns `False` if its input secondary
        structure string is not symmetric so that users can filter
        out un-predictable secondary structures from their data sets.
